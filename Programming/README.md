# Programming 💻
👾 This folder is intended for content related to the programming of the team's robot [Fran Robots](https://github.com/franrobots) used in the Rescue Maze category at [Robocup Junior](https://www.robocup.org/); <br>
⌨️ Included are the **documents**, **photos**, and **code** used.

## Resumo 💾
> 📷 The programming uses **C++** to control the robot's **movement** and Python to **process images** on a Raspberry Pi. <br>
> 📺 We didn't resort to artificial intelligence, we built the entire architecture with the help of **OpenCV**, an open-source library that enables real-time **image manipulation**.
